# Tomorrow CV

This is the template I use for my CV. It's been inspired by [Harunwar's Attractive Resume](https://github.com/Harkunwar/attractive-typst-resume)

I used Bitter as body font and Tomorrow as title font, giving it a slightly more "Techno-futuristic" look.

You can use, remix and modify this template as you want, provided you give me some credit (a link to this project page is enough, dont' worry!)
